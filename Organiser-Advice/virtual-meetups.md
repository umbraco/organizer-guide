# Running virtual meetups

Here are some tips from the London organisers on running virtual meetups.

## Format

At the London in person 'formal' meetups we usually have two talks of around 40 minutes. We feel that's too passive for a virtual meetup and like to have two shorter talks, or just one long one.

It's important to leave time for some good questions and conversations between talks – it's a shame to have to cut things short if you have too much planned – and this helps keep attendees engaged.

### News

We always start with any Umbraco news that has happened since the last meetup.

Rather than a long list of bullet points covering everything, how about focusing on three things that you find most interesting and go into detail on those.

If you're in need of some inspiration for topics, the monthly [Skrift Newsletter](https://bit.ly/skrift59-5) and the weekly [UmbraCoffee](https://www.youtube.com/umbracoffee) series are good sources.

Remember, your audience may not actually know that much about Umbraco so you might need to take some time to explain things in a way that will keep everyone engaged. Saying "Niels Hartvig, the founder of Umbraco" is a much a friendlier approach than just referring to him as "Niels". This is appropriate for in person meetups too of course, it's something we need to keep reminding ourselves!

## Tools

Zoom is the defacto choice for running a virtual meetup. The free accounts have a limit of 40 minutes, whereas 'pro' accounts can host up to 100 attendees without time limitations.

Umbraco HQ have an 'pro' account that can be used for running meetups. Reach out to Ilham Boulghallat on the community Slack around 1 week in advance of your meetup if you would like to use HQ's Zoom.

## In advance

- When you schedule the meeting on Zoom you must use a password.
- Add the Zoom url to meetup.com but NOT in the main description as that would put it in the public domain! There is a specific textbox for the virtual meetup url that is only displayed to registered attendees.
- It is a good idea to also email people on the day of the meetup with the joining information, plus a reminder that they must not share the link with anyone else or post it online.

## Preparing the Zoom call

- Start the call early with the waiting room enabled so you can make sure that you and the other organisers are ready before letting everyone else in.
- Make sure that all organisers are set as 'co-hosts'. If you organise meetups on your own, ask a couple of trusted community members to co-host with you as it is so much easier to have a few of you monitoring what's going on.
- Make sure that you have disabled annotations, screen-sharing, whiteboard, and participants renaming themselves: all these tools have been used for nefarious purposes by 'Zoom bombers'. Of course if your meeting url never makes it into the public domain then you shouldn't have any problems but it is a good idea to be prepared in case it does. Do you know where the 'remove' option is just in case you need to kick someone out? Note that if you remove someone they cannot rejoin so don't try this on someone who should be there!
- It is useful for people, especially first-timers, to know who the meetup organisers are on the call. An easy way to achieve this is to add ' - organiser' to your Zoom name. Co-hosts can change their own name even if you've disabled this for participants.  
- Ideally all the organisers should be visible and aware of what's happening during the call, but if that's not possible, make sure at least one of you is at all times.

## Starting the meetup

When people join the call it can be disconcerting if nothing is happening and everyone is quiet. One option is to have started a screen-share before you let people in, with a slide welcoming people to the meetup and informing them that you'll be starting in a few minutes. Or, what we prefer to do, is to instigate some informal chat with people as they join us. It can help to set a friendly, welcoming tone to the event. If you have lots of participants it might be easier to keep everyone else on mute and just you the organisers have a chat as people arrive.

As part of our introduction we like to get everyone to say a quick hello, tell us their name and where they are. We've had people join from the US, South Africa and other parts of the UK so it is interesting to hear where they are joining from. Perhaps also ask people to say if it's their first time at your meetup, so you can all give a quick cheer to welcome them. You do need to make it clear that it is a quick hello and not much more. If people start doing full introductions then it can go on far too long! You can't tell people to say hello in order, as the sequence on screen and in the participants list is different for everyone. We find it works best when one of the organisers invites each person to speak. Without such direction you will either have silence, or people talking over each other. It's easy to miss someone out, so do remember to ask at the end if you've done that!

If you have lots of people on the call then this won't really viable, and instead you could select just a few people to talk to. Perhaps ask people to raise their hand if they're new, or from abroad, and then ask them to say hello. Of course it is completely up to you how you handle all this, but we've had some feedback that people really appreciated being invited to say something, as otherwise they would have left at the end without ever un-muting themselves.

## Helping speakers

Before you're about to hand over to your speaker, make them a co-host of the meeting so that they can share their screen. Ask your attendees to keep their videos on if they don't mind, as it helps the speakers to see engaged faces as they talk. Usually you'll want to mute everyone before the speaker starts, it's always a good idea to tell people you're doing that so they know you've done it. Some speakers prefer having people un-muted, so it's best to check with them.

If people have questions then it's usually easiest to ask them to post it in the Zoom chat. As the organiser you should be in charge of reading out the questions at the end, don't make the speaker scroll through the chat themselves!

## Recording

We haven't been recording the London meetups as we know this puts some people off from attending. We also want to encourage as many people to turn up as possible.  

If you do decide to record then you should warn your attendees before you start the recording so people can switch off their video if they want. Umbraco HQ have a community channel on YouTube that meetup videos can be published to. Find Arnold Visser on the community Slack for help with that.

## Finishing the meetup

It's a good idea to have a formal end to the meetup, no doubt to say some thank yous and to remind people when the next meetup is. If you want to stay on the call and have some informal chat then make it known that people can stay on for that, but that they're welcome to leave. This stops people feeling rude if they do want to go!

## Any other tips?

If you have any other suggestions for things that have worked well on a virtual meetup we'd love to hear them @umbLondon on Twitter, or let Callum, Lotte or Ravi know (all on the community Slack). We're keen to get back to in person meetups when we're allowed to, but we might continue with some virtual ones...
